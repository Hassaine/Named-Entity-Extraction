git checkout <commit id> // moves between branches, commits that's mean point to a specific commit/branche 
git checkout master // go to the current state (last commit)
git checkout -b <branche name> //create a new branche and switch to it.
git pull origin <name of the branche> // take all informations from github repo, to our local repo and update it
git pull  //basicly we work with 1 branche,before use it we have to track a branche first, "master" by default
git push -u origin master  //Used for the 1st push to remember & track the branch 
git push // Very clear nothing to explain

gitHub is an application that allows you to store remote
repositories on teir servers.

Three ways to interacte with a repo : clone/donwload/fork it
clone it : creates the local version of this repo on your machine
fork it : creates the repo in your github 
download it : download the source files WITHOUT THE .git 

2 ways create local git repo , or create remote repo on github,
connecting github repo to local git repo : git remote add origin https/ssh of the repo 

if u want to check if they are connected properly :  git remote -v => Result shows fetch & push
